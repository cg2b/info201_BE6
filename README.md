# INFO 201 BE6: Public Safety in Seattle
Group members: Cheng Gong, Yingrui Jia, Elizabeth Lin, and Colton Hagan
### Background Information(Cheng)


The theme our group is going to explore is public safety in Seattle. Therefore, we downloaded two datasets that highly represent the certain situation in Seattle, `crime` and `firecall` datasets containing relevant information of date and time of reports, locations of the reports, types of the reports on the website `Seattle Open Data Portal`. This project focuses on people who are concerned about their safety in Seattle. By using R packages and shiny application, we made this report and gives people visualizations of frequency that reported crimes or fire calls differentiate in different neighborhoods or time periods in Seattle.

The blockquote on the right side is the distribution of our work.

### 1. Overview(Teresa)
The two plots are displaying the frequency of *crime* and *firecall* recorded during the year 2017 and 2018. The widget on the right side of the two plots allows users to choose the specific year they want to inspect. The default choice `summary` is designed to show a barplot comparing the total numbers of reports between 2017 and 2018.  The rest of the choices are left for users to pick a certain year and *further explore the distribution in each of 12 `months` in this year* (or to see the trajectory through the whole year).

If users have intentions to dig deeper into the `crime` and `firecall` datasets, the information and plots below would fulfill their expectation.
